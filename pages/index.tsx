      Hi! I am a Game Design major at DePaul University with a passion for production and project
      management. I am an organizer and communicator to my core. I love acting as a support on
      teams to help everyone reach their full potential!
      I transferred from the University of Kansas to DePaul University in the fall of 2020, took a game
      design course, and promptly switched my major from film to game design. After taking a course
      called Introduction to Game Production, I decided to concentrate in production and project
      management.

      I have worked as a research assistant/project manager, a teaching assistant, a game design
      instructor, and now as a producer for DePaul Originals Game Studio.
      Outside of DePaul, I am a hostess at a Brewery and I enjoy traveling, film photography,
      watching basketball, and doing game jams with friends.
