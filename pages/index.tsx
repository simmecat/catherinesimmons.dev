        Catherine Simmons is a game design student at DePaul University. Through
        several group and solo projects, Catherine developed a skill set of
        narrative design, level design, and programming to implement gameplay.
        She is always looking for ways to improve her skills and game literacy
        through learning, practice, feedback, and reading. Through collaborative
        classroom and group environments, Catherine developed strong
        communication skills to effectively convey design goals/ideas and listen
        to others. Catherine is proficient with Unity 2D/3D and Unreal Engine 4.
        She is currently working on updating her knowledge to work with Unreal
        Engine 5. Catherine also has experience with 3D modeling, animation, and
        some rigging in Maya.

        Originally a screenwriting student, Catherine has always had a passion
        for telling compelling stories through all elements of games. This love
        began with both TTRPGs and RPGs, a medium that allowed her to create and
        experience stories that gave players agency over their actions. This
        passion also translated into a love of literature and history. Catherine
        has taken a number of wonderful history courses exploring the Roman
        Empire, colonial America and Indigenous cultures, the Italian
        Renaissance, and the history of Jesus. In her free time, she enjoys
        GMing role-playing games with friends, playing video games, reading, and
        rollerskating.
